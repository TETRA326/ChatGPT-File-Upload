# ChatGPT-File-Upload
This adds an "Upload File" button to https://chat.openai.com. It will take raw-text files (specifically .txt, .js, .py, .html, .css, .json, and .csv) and inserts it to the chat text bar. This ONLY works with raw-text files and currently does not convert non raw-text files (such as .docx) into raw text.

# Install
You can add this directly from the Firefox Add-on store:

https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/chatgpt-file-upload/

- Click `This Firefox`
- Click `Load temporary add-on` and select your .zip

## Option B. Compile the Files Yourself
- Download these 6 files from this repo:
```
- manifest.json

- popup.html
- icon128.png
- icon256.png
```
- Compress those 6 files into a .zip
- In Firefox (or any other Gecko-based browser), go to [about:debugging](about:debugging)
- Click `This Firefox`
- Click `Load temporary add-on` and select your .zip
