# ChatGPT-File-Upload
This adds an "Upload File" button to https://chat.openai.com. It will take raw-text files (specifically .txt, .js, .py, .html, .css, .json, and .csv) and inserts it to the chat text bar. This ONLY works with raw-text files and currently does not convert non raw-text files (such as .docx) into raw text.
